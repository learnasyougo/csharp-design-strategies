# Adapter Pattern
## When to use?
The "friendly name" for an adapter is a "wrapper object", and thus:
- Whenever you have a class, module, or API that would be useful but doesn't match (implement) the interface you require.
- You are designing a class, module, framework or API and you want to ensure it is usable by a wide variety of classes and applications.
