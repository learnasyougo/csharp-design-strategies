# Strategy Pattern
**Using composition rather than using inheritance.**
> The strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one and makes them interchangable aka pluggable). The pattern makes the algorithms vary independently from the clients that use it (aka decoupling it). In other words the client doesn't have top change when the algorithm changes, or when an algorithm is added.
