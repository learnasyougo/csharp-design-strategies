# Observer Pattern
**Observering changing states, without the one changing state needing to know all the *subscribers* up front.**
It's a **push** based pattern, meaning that the objects interested in the change of state don't bother asking the x-time, but the object being observed **notifies** the objects interested (aka the **subscribers**) when it's state has been changed.
