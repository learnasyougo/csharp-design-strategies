# Decorator Pattern
**Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically, providing a flexible alternative to subclassing for extended functionality**.
- Or, in essence, wrapping an object to add extra functionality, like an onion +/-.
- Starting with a component, wrapping it (=> decorating it). Each wrapped one is interchangable.
- The decorator is of the same type of the ones is being decorated. It also "has" the type it's decorating, as it wraps it.

Important to note that this pattern **is not suited** when you care about the **order** of the wrapped items.
